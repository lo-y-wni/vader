/// \brief ++ Variable Tranforms Repository ++
///
/// \details This repository contains a set of functions associated with
/// 'transformations'.
/// The transformations are applied to Atlas data structures.
///
/// Here the term 'transformation' is used in a broad sense.
/// Examples of transformations include model-specific variable changes.
///
/// This is only a temporary repository. In the long term, the Variable Transforms will be
/// stored and processed by the VAriable DErivation Repository (VADER) system.
